# Password--breach--checker
Password Breach Checker is a security tool that checks if a user-provided password has been exposed in known data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API. It also evaluates the strength of newly created passwords using entropy, length, and complexity analysis to determine if a password is strong or weak.
